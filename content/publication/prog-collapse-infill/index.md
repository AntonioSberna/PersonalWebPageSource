abstract: "The response of reinforced concrete (RC) frame building structures to exceptional events like explosions or impacts causing the loss of a primary structural element depends on the robustness of the structural configuration. In the case of a sudden column loss, the resisting mechanism of the involved spans substantially changes, while a progressive collapse mechanism can develop under the arising dynamic loads. The presence of masonry infill walls can substantially modify the overall response to a sudden column loss scenario. In this context, this paper investigates the response of reinforced concrete frame structures undergoing instantaneous column losses in order to assess the influence of masonry infills on the progressive collapse response under dynamic load demands. A recently formulated equivalent-strut macro-modelling approach is employed to reproduce the mechanical interaction between infill walls and the frames. A ten-storey, six-bays 2D reinforced concrete frame is selected as a case study structure considering different reinforcement layouts (seismic or non-seismic design) and column loss scenarios (central column or corner column loss). The simulations are carried out using the fiber-section beam/column elements available in the OpenSees software platform, as they can account for the arching mechanism developing in the post-cracked regime. The dynamic responses of the case-study tests to the sudden column loss scenarios are assessed with and without the inclusion of masonry infills within the structural models.

<!-- ## **Abstract**

The response of reinforced concrete (RC) frame building structures to exceptional events like explosions or impacts causing the loss of a primary structural element depends on the robustness of the structural configuration. In the case of a sudden column loss, the resisting mechanism of the involved spans substantially changes, while a progressive collapse mechanism can develop under the arising dynamic loads. The presence of masonry infill walls can substantially modify the overall response to a sudden column loss scenario. In this context, this paper investigates the response of reinforced concrete frame structures undergoing instantaneous column losses in order to assess the influence of masonry infills on the progressive collapse response under dynamic load demands. A recently formulated equivalent-strut macro-modelling approach is employed to reproduce the mechanical interaction between infill walls and the frames. A ten-storey, six-bays 2D reinforced concrete frame is selected as a case study structure considering different reinforcement layouts (seismic or non-seismic design) and column loss scenarios (central column or corner column loss). The simulations are carried out using the fiber-section beam/column elements available in the OpenSees software platform, as they can account for the arching mechanism developing in the post-cracked regime. The dynamic responses of the case-study tests to the sudden column loss scenarios are assessed with and without the inclusion of masonry infills within the structural models. Results demonstrate that masonry infills introduce a substantial modification of the resisting mechanism and of the dynamic response, limiting the propagation of progressive collapse in most of the considered cases. -->
