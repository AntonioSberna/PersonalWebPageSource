abstract: "The paper presents a novel optimization framework aimed at the minimization of seismic retrofitting-related costs for existing unreinforced masonry building structures. The framework provides the topology optimization of the reinforcements (reinforced plasters) to implement in masonry walls for the accomplishment of seismic safety checks under the reference seismic load combinations. Optimization is carried out by a genetic algorithm (GA) developed in MATLABÂ®, which controls a 3D finite element equivalent frame model of the masonry structure developed in OpenSees. The GA routine iterates the reinforcement configurations employing specific genetic operators. The feasibility of each candidate retrofitting solution is assessed by performing in-plane shear and flexural safety checks of masonry walls. The framework is finally tested with a case study masonry structure supposed to be made of an average-quality or poor-quality masonry. Results will show that the proposed framework can effectively provide the minimization of seismic retrofitting costs for existing masonry structures, providing as output the optimal configuration of the reinforcements within the structural layout."

<!-- ## **Highlights**

* An novel AI-based framework for the seismic retrofitting cost optimization of RC buildings is proposed.

* The framework also controls service life cost through the evaluation of the expected annual loss (EAL).

* The method can provide multiple topological and sizing optimization of the reinforcement.

* The optimization process is based on a genetic algorithm handling a fiber-section model realized in OpenSees.

* The application of the method can effectively reduce retrofitting costs maintaining a specified EAL.

* The framework can be implemented as a tool for cost-effective and sustainable design of retrofitting. -->
